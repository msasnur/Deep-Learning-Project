# Object-Detection-using-CNN
Developed in R using state-of-art techniques in deep learning i.e. CNN and identified objects in any given images. 


- This project was part of Advance Machine Learning course on deep learning. A model was developed in R using state-of-art techniques in deep learning i.e. CNN and identified objects in any given images.

- Used Caltech computational vision group’s image dataset and analyzed these images using CNN with 10 convolution layers.

- In CNN layers, six were fully connected with “relu” activation. Then passed to a layer of dropout, flatten and a couple of dense layers with Sigmoid classification layer.
